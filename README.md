# The Boyfriend Soundfont (Friday Night Funkin')

A collection of SFZ (Sforzando) and DWB (FL Studio) soundfonts in the style of the Boyfriend character from Friday Night Funkin', sampled directly from the original files with UTAU (Original samples ripped from the game by GenoX).

## Usage

The soundfont contains the following sounds

1. Official Chromatics Sustains
2. Aah sustain
3. Eeh sustain
4. Iih sustain
5. Ooh sustain
6. Poh sustains
7. Random Beeps (Oneshot)
8. Random Boops (Oneshot)

### .sfz for all DAWS

Drag the .sfz file into Sforzando ([A Free SFZ player, can be downloaded from here](https://www.plogue.com/downloads.html)). Keyswitches C0 to B0 are mapped to the articulations listed above.

### .dwb for FL Studio

Drag the file into FL Studio. It should automatically load the instrument. Midi channels 1 to 7 are mapped to each of the articulations listed above.

### .sf2 for legacy users (NOT RECOMMENDED)

Due to the format limitations, sf2 doesn't support round robins, so it lacks the Random beeps and Random Boops instruments. If possible, use the SFZ version.

### .dwp for FL Mobile Users

Load into FL Mobile like you would do for other soundfonts.

### License

Apache v2, like the original Friday Night Funkin. Samples ripped from KawaiSprite's tracks, belonging to the FNF Source Code.
